# PC060HA 'CIU'

This chip serves as a 4-bit communication interface between the main and sub CPUs.

Its functionality seems to be included in the later '''TC0140SYT''' chip.

According to MAME, it is used in the following Taito games:
* Asuka & Asuka
* Cameltry
* Champion Wrestler
* Daisenpu
* Darius
* Exzisus
* Fighting hawk
* Gokidetor
* Hit The Ice
* Master of Weapons
* Midnight Landing
* Operation Wolf
* Rainbow Islands
* Rastan
* Taito Bingo Wave
* Tetris
* Top Speed
* Violence Fight
* Volfied

Both directions have four 4-bit register groups with half-full and full flags, along with NMI, MUTE and RESET control.

The schematic was traced from the chip's silicon die and should represent exactly how it is internally constructed.

Thanks to @Ace646546 for donating the chip.
